## Summary

We will parallelize an Othello (a variant of Reversi) minimax solver with alpha-beta pruning. We will investigate how we can speed up searching the game tree to find the best available moves as well as the alpha-beta algorithm that reduces the search space.

## Background

Reversi is a two-player board game invented in the late 19th century, in which opponents place white- and black-colored discs on an 8x8 grid. With each move, players try to “outflank” their opponent’s discs by bounding them in a straight line, thus flipping their color. The player with the most discs of their color on the board wins, and the game ends when no more valid moves can be made. We will be studying Othello, a modern variant of the game that has a predefined starting placement of discs.

The minimax algorithm is a recursive decision procedure for choosing the next move in a two-player game, so it can be easily applied to Othello. Each possible resultant state of a move is assigned a value based on a heuristic function, where negative values are chosen by the minimizing player and positive ones are chosen by the maximizing player. We will likely include disc count, move count, and control of corner squares in our heuristic function — of course, this may change depending on the results of our analysis.

In effect, minimax searches the entire tree of possible moves from each starting position, so its performance is strongly tied to the branching factor of the game tree. Alpha-beta pruning is a strategy that reduces the search space by eliminating (or “pruning”) branches that cannot possibly be the maximum or minimum choice from a particular position (i.e., moves that minimax would never choose anyway).

Since the minimax algorithm has to evaluate every possible move from a given board state and this computation is independent, we believe there is a great opportunity for parallel speedup here. We chose Othello because its rules are fairly straightforward but it produces very large game trees, which will demonstrate the parallel speedup we achieve. While the alpha-beta optimization is not as easily parallelizable due to its sequential nature, we believe we can still perform some parallel optimizations in computing the minimum/maximum move and by pruning chunks of moves concurrently.

## Challenges

**Encoding the rules of the game and board state.** Before we can begin parallelizing the Othello minimax solver, we will need to write a representation of the game including board states, moves, etc. This will be a bit of a design and implementation challenge as we want to ensure that our solution is correct, easy to use, and does not hinder the performance of the solver.

**Alpha-beta is inherently sequential.** In order to achieve good speedup, we will need to consider the tradeoff between perfect information and parallelizing, i.e. total amount of work performed vs. parallelizing the work. Deciding what to parallelize in alphabeta will be an important decision: we can reduce the time to find the minimum/maximum child to log(N) from N, but we may also consider losing some information to parallelize different branches and perform alphabeta independently for those.

**Choosing the best method of parallelism.** There are multiple axes of parallelism in this project, and different methods may be suitable for each. We would like to explore CUDA, OpenMP, and possibly Cilk Plus for parallelizing this problem. 

**Choosing the correct search depth.** As the search tree can become very large, we may want to limit the search depth to improve performance. Tuning this parameter may prove to be a challenge. We may need to use heuristics to improve our search space as well. 

## Resources

Software: C++, CUDA, OpenMP

Machines: Gates cluster machines, PSC machines

No datasets will be used for this project as we will be implementing the Othello game and moves will be generated by the solver.
